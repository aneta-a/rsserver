1. Download and install node.js (nodejs.org)
2. Install the ws package (https://github.com/websockets/ws)
3. In a terminal, run "node rsserver"
4. In a browser, go to http://127.0.0.1:1729/
5. In GAP, execute the following commands:
LoadPackage("scscp");
cs:=InputOutputTCPStream("localhost", 1728);
In the terminal where rsserver runs you should now read "tcp client connected".

If you want to run a browser part on a remote computer, launch node with the IP address of
the server as the second argument, for example:
node rsserver 192.168.178.33
GAP and node should always run in the same computer, so the first argument in 
InputOutputTCPStream should always be "localhost".
You can use other ports for the HTTP and TCP servers by specifying them 
as the third and the fourth argument respectively:
node rsserver 192.168.178.33 8080 1337

To send data to the client, just write them into the created stream, for example
WriteLine( cs, "FUNCTION -1.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 1.0 0.0 1.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0\nCYCLES 0.0 0.0 1 2 -1.0 0.0 0 2 Infinity any 2 1" );

To receive data from the client, press the "Submit" button in the browser window, then read the same TCP stream in GAP. 

One can also change some configuration parameteres from the terminal, where rsserver runs. Type "config set [name value [name value...]]". To read a current parameter value type "config get [name]".
